                    &lt;p>Welcome to the help page for &lt;span>Join&lt;/span>, your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what &lt;span>Join&lt;/span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.&lt;/p>
                    &lt;h2>What is Join?&lt;/h2>
                    &lt;p>&lt;span>Join&lt;/span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.&lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). &lt;span>Join&lt;/span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.&lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>It is important to note that &lt;span>Join&lt;/span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.&lt;/p>
                    &lt;h2>How to use it&lt;/h2>
                    &lt;p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use &lt;span>Join&lt;/span>:&lt;/p>
                    &lt;ol>
                        &lt;li>
                            &lt;h3>Exploring the Board&lt;/h3>
                            &lt;p>When you log in to &lt;span>Join&lt;/span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".&lt;/p>
                        &lt;/li>
                        &lt;li>
                            &lt;h3>Creating Contacts&lt;/h3>
                            &lt;p>In &lt;span>Join&lt;/span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.&lt;/p>
                        &lt;/li>
                        &lt;li>
                            &lt;h3>Adding Cards&lt;/h3>
                            &lt;p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.&lt;/p>
                        &lt;/li>
                        &lt;li>
                            &lt;h3>Moving Cards&lt;/h3>
                            &lt;p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.&lt;/p>
                        &lt;/li>
                        &lt;li>
                            &lt;h3>Deleting Cards&lt;/h3>
                            &lt;p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.&lt;/p>
                            &lt;p>Remember that using &lt;span>Join&lt;/span> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.&lt;/p>
                            &lt;p>Have more questions about &lt;span>Join&lt;/span>? Feel free to contact us at [Your Contact Email]. We're here to help you!&lt;/p>
                        &lt;/li>
                    &lt;/ol>
                    &lt;h2>Enjoy using Join!&lt;/h2>

                    &lt;p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication via email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.&lt;/p>

                    &lt;h3>Notice Regarding the Responsible Party&lt;/h3>
                    &lt;p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:&lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>Developer Akademie GmbH&lt;br>
                    Tassiloplatz 25,&lt;br>
                    81541 Munich&lt;/p>

                    &lt;p>Email: info@developerakademie.com&lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).&lt;/p>

                    &lt;h3>Storage Period&lt;/h3>
                    &lt;p>Unless a specific storage period is mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion takes place after these reasons cease to exist.&lt;/p>

                    &lt;h3>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website&lt;/h3>
                    &lt;p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special data categories according to Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is also carried out based on &amp;sect; 25(1) TDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing can also be carried out based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the relevant legal bases in each individual case is provided in the following sections of this privacy policy.&lt;/p>

                    &lt;h3>Recipients of Personal Data&lt;/h3>
                    &lt;p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This sometimes requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only share personal data if it is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., data transfer to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits data sharing. When using data processors, we only transfer personal data to our customers based on a valid data processing contract. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.&lt;/p>

                    &lt;h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing&lt;/h3>
                    &lt;p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.&lt;/p>

                    &lt;h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)&lt;/h3>
                    &lt;p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).&lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).&lt;/p>

                    &lt;h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority&lt;/h3>
                    &lt;p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.&lt;/p>

                    &lt;h3>Right to Data Portability&lt;/h3>
                    &lt;p>You have the right to have data that we process based on your consent or in performance of a contract automatically delivered to you or to a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.&lt;/p>

                    &lt;h3>Information, Rectification, and Erasure&lt;/h3>
                    &lt;p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right at any time to obtain information about your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to rectification or erasure of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.&lt;/p>

                    &lt;h3>Right to Restriction of Processing&lt;/h3>
                    &lt;p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. To do this, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing applies in the following cases:&lt;/p>
                    &lt;ul>
                        &lt;li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.&lt;/li>
                        &lt;li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.&lt;/li>
                        &lt;li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.&lt;/li>
                        &lt;li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your and our interests. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.&lt;/li>
                    &lt;/ul>
                    &lt;p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data – apart from being stored – may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.&lt;/p>

                    &lt;h3>Cookies&lt;/h3>
                    &lt;p>Our websites use so-called “cookies.” Cookies are small data packets and do not cause any damage to your device. They are stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit ends. Permanent cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them yourself or an automatic deletion by your web browser occurs.&lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>Cookies can originate from us (first-party cookies) or from third-party companies (third-party cookies). Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services of third-party companies within websites (e.g., cookies for handling payment services).&lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or displaying videos). Other cookies can be used to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes.&lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>Cookies that are necessary to carry out the electronic communication process, to provide certain functions requested by you (e.g., for the shopping cart function), or to optimize the website (e.g., cookies to measure web audience) are stored based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of their services. If consent for the storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies was requested, processing is exclusively based on this consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and &amp;sect; 25(1) TDDG); the consent can be revoked at any time.&lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and allow cookies only in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be limited.&lt;/p>
                    &lt;p>Which cookies and services are used on this website can be found in this privacy policy.&lt;/p>
